Challenge 1: What's your name? (From HackerRank - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/whats-your-name/problem?isFullScreen=true)

You'll have two variables for first name and last name.  Your goal is to print a string in the following format:
'Hello first_name last_name!  You just delved into Python!'

For example, if the first name is "John" and the last name is "Doe", then you should print:
'Hello John Doe!  You just delved into Python!'
"""


"""
Challenge 2:
Create a loop that will print *every other* value in a list, starting with the value at index 0, index 2, etc.

For example (feel free to make up your own lists - use your own variables and values!):
my_list = [8, 1, "Hello", "green", True, 4, -1.5] # You should print 8, "Hello", True and -1.5 in this example
# Your loop goes here.
"""


"""
Challenge 3:
Write a function that accepts a string as input and returns the number of vowels found in the string.
For this exercise, "a", "e", "i", "o" and "u" are vowels; we will not count "y" for this challenge.
If it helps, assume the string is all lower-case for now.  Then try to make it work regardless of if the
letters are upper- or lower-case.

For example: given "tommy", return 1 as "o" is a vowel, but "y" is not.  "adrian" should return 3.

Challenge 4:
Given a list of dictionaries as input in the format below, return a new list containing only the names.

Format:
some_variable = [
    {
        "name": "Adrian",
        "favorite_food": "Pizza",
        "favorite_number": 88
    },
    {
        "name": "Jenny",
        "favorite_food": "Sushi",
        "favorite_number": 24
    },
]

In this example, we should get ["Adrian", "Jenny"] as those are the names found.  Make this work for all lists,
so please make up your own examples!
