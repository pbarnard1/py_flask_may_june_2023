- Don't forget about the 20-minute rule and Dojo Hall!
- Remember to read the material BEFORE the lecture that day!
- To pass the course:
    - Need at least 15 out of 16 core assignments (try to do as many practice assignments as you can)
    - Need at least 11 (preferably 12) out of 16 discussion topics
    - Pass the belt exam (have 3 attempts, need to get 15+ core assignments done to be eligible for test)

## Announcements:
- Lectures for the next 3 weeks of content will be 90 minutes each (5 to 6:30 PM Pacific) due to the huge amount of content to cover.  They will be recorded in their entirety if you are unable to attend live or can't stay the entire time.
- If you do Users CR first, make sure you submit that BEFORE working on Users CRUD Modularized!
- If you submit the Users CRUD Modularized assignment BEFORE submitting the Users CR assignment, make sure you submit for BOTH assignments!!  The same code for both is fine.

## Core assignments this week:
- HTML Table
- Counter
- Dojo Survey
- Users CR

Need at least 15 out of 16 done total this course to satisfy this requirement and to be eligible for the exam at the end of week 6!

## Discussion topics reminder:
- Due Sunday by 11:59 PM Pacific!

Need at least 11 (recommended 12) out of 16 discussion topics to satisfy this requirement!

## Outline for today:
- Brief overview of forms
- GET vs. POST requests (HTTP request methods)
- Identify routes to build from wireframe
- Sending data from the form to the server
- Redirecting and why it's important
- Session
    - Saving stuff to session:
        - Mock login
        - Form for adding content creators (soon we'll tie this to MySQL)
    - IMPORTANT PSA: In the future, we'll use session primarily only for identifying who's logged in.  For today, we will use session for holding data from forms and to see who's "logged in".  Session should normally not be used for holding form data; we're using session for form data today only until we tie in our database from MySQL.
- Overview of modularization
- Create a modularized project from scratch (will cover Wednesday)
