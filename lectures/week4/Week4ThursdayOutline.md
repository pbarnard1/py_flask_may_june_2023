# Python PT - outline for Week 4: Thursday, May 25, 2023

## Reminders:
- Please remember to get an early start with assignments and discussion topics every week!
- Don't forget about the 20-minute rule and Dojo Hall!
- Remember to read the material BEFORE the lecture that day!
- To pass the course:
    - Need at least 15 out of 16 core assignments (try to do as many practice assignments as you can)
    - Need at least 11 (preferably 12) out of 16 discussion topics
    - Pass the belt exam (have 3 attempts, need to get 15+ core assignments done to be eligible for test)

## Core assignments this week:
- HTML Table
- Counter
- Dojo Survey
- Users CR - __don't forget to include your schema .mwb file!__

Need at least 15 out of 16 done total this course to satisfy this requirement and to be eligible for the exam at the end of week 6!

## IMPORTANT announcements:
- **This week's discussion topics are due THIS Sunday, May 28 - NOT MONDAY, May 29 or the Sunday after, June 4.**
- **Make sure you do some coding during the next week!  There will be no office hours or lectures, so the onus is on you to keep your skills fresh!  Use this as an opportunity to catch up if you're behind - or work ahead!**
- **TAs will be out - and thus Dojo Hall will be closed - from Sunday, May 28, through Saturday, June 3.  TAs will be around on May 27, and will be back starting Sunday, June 4.  I will be available Tuesday-Friday next week if you need anything.**
- **When submitting your Users CR assignment, please include your ERD - that is, your .mwb file!  Starting in week 5, please include your .mwb file in your assignments, as those will use a database - you'll need to do this for the exam!!**
- If you do Users CR first, make sure you submit that BEFORE working on Users CRUD Modularized!
- If you submit the Users CRUD Modularized assignment BEFORE submitting the Users CR assignment, make sure you submit for BOTH assignments!!  The same code for both is fine.

## Discussion topics reminder:

Need at least 11 (recommended 12) out of 16 discussion topics to satisfy this requirement!
