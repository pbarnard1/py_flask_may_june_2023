# Printing values and using strings
x = 8 # Change this value so that you can see the strings change

print(f"The value of x is {x}") # f-string
print("The value of x is",x) # One way to combine - only works for print statements
print("The value of x is ",x) # This leads to two spaces between instead of 1, as the comma will add the space for you
print("The value of x is " + str(x)) # MUST use the str() function to convert a number to a string; this also works when not using a print statement
