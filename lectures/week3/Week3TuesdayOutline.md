- Basic things to know when running queries in MySQL Workbench (e.g. opening tables, running queries)
- MySQL queries - the CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations
    - Start with the "one" side of the one-to-many relationship
    - The "many" side of the one-to-many relationship - there's one very important column needed when adding to the DB!
- Joins and left joins
- Important tips when changing your ERD:
    - Edit your ERD, then re-forward engineer (make sure you drop your schema!)
    - From this point on when you start building Flask apps with databases in about a week: 
        - Drop your schema, then forward engineer, then test before submitting an assignment/exam
